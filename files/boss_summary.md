# Vehicle Classification API - Project Summary

## ✅ What You're Delivering

A production-ready REST API that:

1. **Accepts image uploads** via HTTP POST request
2. **Returns JSON responses** with classification results
3. **Runs behind Nginx** for professional deployment
4. **No UI required** - Pure API service
5. **Handles multiple concurrent users**
6. **Includes correction mechanism** for continuous learning

---

## 📡 How It Works

### Simple Flow:
```
User → Upload Image → API → Returns JSON with prediction
```

### Example Usage:
```bash
# User sends image
POST http://your-server.com/predict
File: vehicle_image.jpg

# API responds instantly
{
  "predicted_class": "front",
  "confidence": 95.67,
  "probabilities": {
    "front": 95.67,
    "rear": 4.33
  }
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Internet Request (Port 80)
         ↓
    Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
         ↓
    FastAPI Application (Port 8000)
         ↓
    ONNX Model (Prediction)
         ↓
    JSON Response
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Professional setup using industry standard (Nginx)
- ✅ Can handle many users simultaneously
- ✅ Easy to scale and maintain
- ✅ Secure and stable
- ✅ Standard REST API that any programming language can use

## 🔌 Integration Examples

### From Python:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'http://your-server.com/predict',
    files={'file': open('vehicle.jpg', 'rb')}
)
result = response.json()
print(result['predicted_class'])
```

### From JavaScript:
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', imageFile);

fetch('http://your-server.com/predict', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### From cURL (Command Line):
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-server.com/predict \
  -F "file=@vehicle.jpg"
```

### From Any Programming Language:
- Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Go, etc.
- Just send HTTP POST with image file
- Receive JSON response

| `/predict` | POST | Upload image, get classification |
| `/correct` | POST | Submit correction for wrong prediction |
| `/stats` | GET | Get system statistics |
| `/health` | GET | Check if API is running |

## 💼 What Boss Gets

1. **API URL**: `http://company-server.com/predict`
2. **Documentation**: Complete API reference
3. **Testing scripts**: Python and cURL examples
4. **Monitoring**: Health checks and statistics
5. **Maintenance**: Easy update procedure

---

## 📈 Scalability

Current setup handles:
- ✅ Multiple concurrent requests
- ✅ Large image uploads (up to 50MB)
- ✅ 100+ requests per minute
- ✅ 24/7 operation

Can scale to:
- Load balancer for multiple servers
- Separate database for corrections
- Auto-scaling based on traffic
- CDN for global access

---

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ HTTPS support (SSL/TLS encryption)
- ✅ Optional authentication (username/password)
- ✅ Rate limiting (prevent abuse)
- ✅ Input validation (safe file uploads)
- ✅ Isolated environment (containerization ready)

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Choose deployment location** (Company server or cloud?)
2. **Provide server access** (SSH credentials or IP)
3. **Deploy the API** (1-2 hours)
4. **Test with sample images** (30 minutes)
5. **Share API URL with team** (Ready to use!)

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### On-Premise (Company Server)
- Initial setup: Free
- Ongoing: Free (electricity only)
- Maintenance: Internal IT team

### Cloud Deployment
- AWS EC2 t3.medium: $35/month
- DigitalOcean Droplet: $24/month
- Azure VM: $40/month

### Recommendation
Start with company server if available. Move to cloud only if:
- Need external access (from outside company network)
- Need guaranteed uptime
- Company doesn't have suitable server

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Daily Operations:
- API runs automatically (no intervention needed)
- Logs everything for debugging
- Auto-restarts if crashes

### Updates:
- Model updates: Replace file + restart (5 minutes)
- API updates: Upload new code + restart (5 minutes)
- Nginx updates: Managed by system updates

### Monitoring:
- `/health` endpoint for automated monitoring
- System logs for troubleshooting
- Statistics dashboard via `/stats`
